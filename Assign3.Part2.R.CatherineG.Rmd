## Question 3.2.1
```{r}
# Link to my github function/assignment part 2
# https://github.com/CGuazzoneJASP/ProgrammingCourse
# Function 1
# I am creating a function that continuously prints "You can still sleep"
# until the time goes to 7am. When this happens, it prints "Wake up!".
# install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")

alarm <- function(alarm){
  current_time <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())$hour
  if(current_time == 7)
  {print("Wake up!")}
  while(current_time != 7)
  {print("You can still sleep")}
}

# testing my function, at 10pm:
alarm()
# Output:
# [1] "You can still sleep" prints forever

# Function 2
# Assessing if someone is taller or shorter than Michael Jordan
your_height_in_cm <- 160
michael_jordan <- function(michael_jordan){
  if(your_height_in_cm < 198)
  {print("You're shorter than Michael Jordan!")}
   if(your_height_in_cm > 198)
   {print("You're taller than Michael Jordan!")}
  if(your_height_in_cm == 198)
  {print("You're the same height as Michael Jordan!")}
}

# Testing my function
your_height_in_cm <- 160
michael_jordan(your_height_in_cm)
# Output
# [1] "You're shorter than Michael Jordan!"

your_height_in_cm <- 200
michael_jordan(your_height_in_cm)
# [1] "You're taller than Michael Jordan!"
```

## Question 3.2.2

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# devtools::install_github("djnavarro/jasmines")
library(dplyr)
library(jasmines)


my_amazing_art <- use_seed(123) %>% # Set the seed of Râ€˜s random number generator, which is useful for creating simulations or random objects that can be reproduced.
  scene_discs(
    rings = 30, 
    points = 10000, 
    size = 20
  ) %>%
  mutate(ind = 1:n()) %>%
  unfold_warp(
    iterations = 10,
    scale = .3, 
    output = "layer" 
  ) %>%
  unfold_tempest(
    iterations = 5,
    scale = .01
  ) %>%
  style_ribbon(
    color = "#C7E63E",
    colour = "ind",
    alpha = c(1,1),
    background = "#687B15"
  )

my_amazing_art
```

## Including Plots
Embedding my plot:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(my_amazing_art)
```
